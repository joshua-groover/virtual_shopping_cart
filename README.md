# virtual_shopping_cart

### This repository contains the infrastructure for a virtual shopping cart that stores a product, price, discount, and quantity in the ShoppingCart/List/ListItem files.

### The shopping cart is really an array or linked list (depending on the choise of the user). This allows for easier usage of the ShoppingCart than a java array by giving the user functions like add, remove, isEmpty, isIn, length, and clear. 

### Additionally, the file ShoppingCartUnitTests runs a series of checks to ensure the virtual shopping cart pipeline is fully operational.
